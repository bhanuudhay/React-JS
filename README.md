# ðŸš€ My React.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my React.js study repository! This is where Iâ€™ll be documenting my progress as I dive into React and its ecosystem. Here, youâ€™ll find projects, exercises, and notes on all things React, including components, state, props, hooks, and more.

#  Learning & Overview

This repository contains the learning and exploration of React concepts, setup, and key features. Below is an overview of what was learned during the development process, tools used, and various concepts such as hooks, virtual DOM, reconciliation, props, and more.

## Overview of React

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UI), particularly for single-page applications (SPA). It is developed and maintained by Facebook.

### Key Features of React:
- **React DOM**: Used for building web applications.
- **React Native**: Used for mobile application development.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a lightweight copy of the real DOM to improve performance by reducing unnecessary updates.
  
### Key Concepts:
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML, which allows us to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
- **Components**: A React component is a function that returns JSX. Components help to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces.
- **Props**: Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
- **State**: React allows components to maintain their state with the help of hooks like `useState`.
