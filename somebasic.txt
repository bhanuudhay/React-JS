react is a like a java script script library 
used for making front end
made by facebook
solve the problem of ghost messaging 

it has two parts 
react-dom basically used when you are building website 
react-native used for mobile app development  + react dom

ways to create react project

npm - node package manager  - it is type of installer that allow you to download libraries

npx - node package executer : if you dont want to install and just want to execute directly you can use npx

npx create-react-app (create-react-app  is a utility) utility is like software (is software ke through ap ek nayaa project bna skta hai )

npx create-react-app project_name 

imp - take care of naming convention otherwise it will take more 

create-react-app : yeh ek bulky utility hai (bahut sari cheeza aaisa deti hai jo apko chahiya nhi)

so inspite of this we use vite and parcel 

they both are utility

entry point for react is : package.json file that contain information about the project 

in package.json there are testing libraries  , scripts and web-vitals (track the performance)

scripts - scripts hi projects ko chalti hai 

start : development environment
build : production 
test : test cases run
eject : app kon react se eject kr deta ho ab aaga koi aur library use krunga 

lintconfig : error aa jata hai app aur improve kar skta ho 

now how to start a project 

npm run start  : to start a project

when  you deploy in production

build folder is share not deploy folder


other method to create react project through vite 

npm create vite@latest

all things are similar in package.json

except devDependencies

only use during development phase 

how to run 

go to terminal 

cd project_name

npm  i
