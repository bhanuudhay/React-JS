// library  : is type of independent object and do not have limitation
//  framework : is like case senstive and we don't modify on our own

react is a like a java script script library 
used for making front end
made by facebook
solve the problem of ghost messaging 

it has two parts 
react-dom basically used when you are building website 
react-native used for mobile app development  + react dom

ways to create react project

npm - node package manager  - it is type of installer that allow you to download libraries

npx - node package executer : if you dont want to install and just want to execute directly you can use npx

npx create-react-app (create-react-app  is a utility) utility is like software (is software ke through ap ek nayaa project bna skta hai )

npx create-react-app project_name 

imp - take care of naming convention otherwise it will take more 

create-react-app : yeh ek bulky utility hai (bahut sari cheeza aaisa deti hai jo apko chahiya nhi)

so inspite of this we use vite and parcel 

they both are utility

entry point for react is : package.json file that contain information about the project 

in package.json there are testing libraries  , scripts and web-vitals (track the performance)

scripts - scripts hi projects ko chalti hai 

start : development environment
build : production 
test : test cases run
eject : app kon react se eject kr deta ho ab aaga koi aur library use krunga 

lintconfig : error aa jata hai app aur improve kar skta ho 

now how to start a project 

npm run start  : to start a project

when  you deploy in production

build folder is share not deploy folder


other method to create react project through vite 

npm create vite@latest

all things are similar in package.json

except devDependencies

only use during development phase 

how to run 

go to terminal 

cd project_name

npm  i : node module not available by default so to install it we execute npm i in vite 

node modules ke andar package.json meh jitni bhi dependencies thi woh hoti hai

package-lock.json  : iske ander dependencies lock ho jati hai ki yeh sirf isi version pe chala ga  // stable ver of dependencies is locked here 

manifest.json : used for mobile devices 

important  :  index.html  : yehi to main page jo load hoga isliye isko spa bola jata  hai

SPA :-  Single Page Application 

<noscript> :  agar koi js file execute nhi hai toh yeh hama btata hai 

ReactDom :: DOM ek tree structure hai like in java script eg attribute  , tag ets 

react ka apna ek  khud ka dom hota hai jo virtual dom hota hai 

react give us power of jsx  that we can render our html element 

<React.StrictMode>yeh sirf development ke hai taki ap kuch optimization kar sko 

<App />  : yeh ek function hai jo simply kuch return krta hai 

export default App; //  this syntax is basically  ap ek function lo function ke ander html return krdo  
aur main us html ko render krwa dunga

java script ke through html likh pa rha hai 

"react-scripts"  :  secretly inject index.js (our javascript file) in our index.html 

jsx : jab aap  components bnata ho

jsx jo hai enclosing tag ke under wrap hona chahiya matlab  ap sirf ek hi element return kar skta ho 

and function name apko capital rakhna padaga for ambiguity like issue 

like return ( <div>  iska under kuch bhi link do </div>)

yeh above problem itni bar repeat ho rhi thi ki iska ek simple solution de diya 

simply return <> anything inside </>

<> </> this thing is called fragment  # IMP # IMP #IMP

while rendering in both vite and react 

diff in react we can use both js and jsx  , jsx is not mandatory 
but in vite jsx is there as a component

similarities :: function name should be capital in both of them

agar kuch return krwa rha ho toh jsx otherwise js is also fine
